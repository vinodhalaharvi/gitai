## Getting Started

Before running the project, you need to set up your environment:

1. **Export Your OpenAI API Key**

   Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key. This is required for the application to
   authenticate with OpenAI's services.

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'

2. Build your project

   ```bash
   go build
   ```
3. Run your project

   ```bash
   ./gitai show me the logs
   ```
